thmm1.r contains all of the algorithms from the article Topological Hidden Markove Models 
(https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13608) coded in R. 

articleSims.r contains code to recreate the simulations included in the above article.

The files en_climate_daily_AB_3012208_????_P1D.csv contain climatological data from
